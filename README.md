# LeafyPi - API Service

api for garden bot solution

## Requirements

- mongodb
- build-tools
- raspberry pi

## Use

run `npm i` to install all dependencies

run `npm run dev` to run the local development version for testing

> it will be using mock services instead of any raspberry pi connectors

run `npm run prod` to run the server with the "real" services.

> this will only work when run on a raspberry pi, as it needs gpio inputs to function
